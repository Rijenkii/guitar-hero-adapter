# Arduino Wiitar adapter

## Requirements

* Arduino with an ATmega32u4 processor (Leonardo, Micro)
* AMS1117 module or similar (5V -> 3.3V)
* Bi-directional logic level converter (5V <-> 3.3V)

You can *technically* omit last the last two items if you are risky (Wii Nunchucks
can work at 5V, but I haven't seen anyone doing same with guitars).
